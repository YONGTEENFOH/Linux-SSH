How to SSH into Azure ubuntu server using Windows Subsystems for Linux via Powershell terminal

Pre-requisite:
# Enable virtualization on your uefi settings, this step is needed for wsl to be installed properly
Start  > Settings > System  > Recovery > Advanced startup, then select Restart now.
Troubleshoot > Advanced options > UEFI Settings > Restart.

# This will install windows subsystem for linux, otherwise your chmod command won't work later during configuration for linux server
open powershell and run "wsl --install"
create username and password
restart machine

# Create a folder in wsl environment, this is the default location to store pem file
mkdir .ssh

# To move pem file from windows file system to wsl file system
run " cp /mnt/c/Users/teenf/Downloads/azureuser.pem ~/.ssh/azureuser.pem"

# Connect to ubuntu server
run "ssh -i ~/.ssh/azureuser.pem azureuser@4.194.xx.xxx"
